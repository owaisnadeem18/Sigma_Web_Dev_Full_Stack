// var a = 4;

// var b = 5;

// var c = a + b;

// console.log(a + b);

// let d = null;

// console.log(typeof d); // Interview Question type of null is object . May be it is a mistake in JavaScript but because there is so much code is written in JavaScript in this way . That's why we can not change it now

// primitive data types and non-premitive data types in our JavaScript

// Object in JavaScript is basically the colection of values

// the syntax of object is:

let obj = {
  name: "Owais",
  age: 22,
};

console.log(obj["age"]);
